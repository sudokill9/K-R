# K&R Exercises

This repository is just the place where I place my answers to the exercises in
the book "The C Programming Language", second edition, by Brian Kernighan and
Dennis Ritchie.

## Organization

The source code is distributed between the folders according to which chapter
the exercise belongs to. Every exercise is done in a separate source file.
Compiling them should be straight forward.

Not all files are suposed to compile. Some exercises in K&R are meant for the
reader to explore compiler errors.

The objetive is not to be an extensive list of all code present in the book,
but just the exercises.
